<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### What's inside this repo?

- Socket.io for real time updates.
- API Clients for retrieving angular tree grid data.
- Production standard structuring of the application.


#### Task description

Created a single webpage of TreeGrid using : https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/treegrid/virtual
and other "Angular TreeGrid" samples. I have used Syncfusion EJ2 Angular TreeGrid (free trial version), but it doesn't support all required features, so, I  have to write custom code! 

Saved all data in JSON file (not database). Initially, the TreeGrid shall have 50K rows (RowID=1,2,3...50K), all users shall edit this single TreeGrid (i.e. JSON file on server). 

All users' row-edits and column-settings are Persistent and Realtime-Sync‚Äôd between client sessions, it is achieved using Socket.IO. 

Implemented the following 2 Context Menus on this TreeGrid: (Note: Certain menu item has üóπ symbol - meaning this item shall function as On/Off switch, while üóπ or ‚òê symbol serves as the On/Off status indicator) 

Context Menu 1 - Right-click (mouse) or long-press (mobile) a "Column Header", to pop-up some menu items: 

FreezeCol ‚òë: Freeze all left-hand-side (including current) columns, See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/frozen-column 
(When turning Freeze On, please switch from Virtual Scroll to Infinite Scroll to avoid a known conflict in library. Freeze Off shall switch back to Virtual Scroll) 

FilterCol ‚òë: Enable "Filter Bar" in Parent Hierarchy Mode, See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/filter

 MultiSort ‚òë: ‚ÄúOff: No sorting allowed. On: All combination of sorting allowed‚Äù, See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/sorting 
Context Menu 2 - Rright-click (mouse) or long-press (mobile) a "Row", to pop-up  menu items: 
 DelRow; (Delete Task / Subtask code to call the required apis has been written but calling on click of DelRow is pending. I need to add it to the eventlistener method.)
 
MultiSelect ‚òë: Enable user to "Multi-select" rows on PC and Mobile, See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/selection 


### Built With

- [Angular]() - TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework.
- [Socket.io]() - Event driven JavaScript library for real time web applications.
